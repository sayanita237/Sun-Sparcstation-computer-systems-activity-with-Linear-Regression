# Sun-Sparcstation-computer-systems-activity-with-Linear-Regression

The comp-activ databases is a collection of a computer systems activity measures .
The data was collected from a Sun Sparcstation 20/712 with 128 Mbytes of memory running in a multi-user university department. Users would typically be doing a large variety of tasks ranging from accessing the internet, editing files or running very cpu-bound programs. 

As you are a budding data scientist you thought to find out a linear equation to build a model to predict 'usr'(Portion of time (%) that cpus run in user mode) and to find out how each attribute affects the system to be in 'usr' mode using a list of system attributes.
